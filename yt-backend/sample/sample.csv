"I’m truly humbled by the overwhelming response to this video—thank you all for watching, sharing, and caring deeply about these issues. I wanted to address some of the most common comments:

1)To those asking about my safety: Thank you for your concern! I’m completely safe. ☺ Many of the issues discussed in this video are already openly debated on Chinese social media, and I actually drew a lot of insights from those discussions while making this video.

2) Will there be more investigations like this? Honestly, I’m not sure. While I believe in shedding light on these topics, I also recognize that labor conditions in global manufacturing—not just at Shein—are deeply tied to complex supply and demand forces. Real change takes time.

3)To those rethinking their shopping habits: It means so much to hear that this video has made some of you more aware. If there’s one takeaway, it’s that ALL fast fashion—not just Shein—often relies on labor conditions that may be far worse than what most consumers realize.

Again, thank you for engaging with this discussion so thoughtfully. Your comments have given me a lot to reflect on!🙂",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
The fact that i got a shein ad on this video is diabolical,shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
A 8am -10pm shift being the average actually makes me feel sick to my stomach,shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"This IS journalism, and very high quality and courageous journalism at that... Excellent work, but very depressing to see.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"Thank you for doing this work and sharing this story. Unethical labor practices is an issue I wish ppl would speak up about everywhere. Nothing beats combating issues from the source. As someone who has struggled in their own field with corporations not willing to pay their employees fair wages I feel this personally. I think as consumers we need to be aware of the work that goes into supplying us our needs/wants. Ppl need to be willing to pay real life value even if it is more expensive and companies need to be willingly to pay their workers actual livable wages and cover health and hazards. Fueling dangerous work environment that literally cause injury on top of it is just wrong. This isn’t to say that they shouldn’t work or that we should put them out of business, because that isn’t fair to them. However, a change needs to happen.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"As someone who is a tailor and works in the fashion industry, it always shocks me how people can still defend such companies while also having no grasp of how much work it actually is to make a garment. Many people treat their clothes like throw-away items that are used only once or twice. But clothes are meant to last for years, they are made for you to spend your life in them, not just one party night.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"Not only Shein, even the luxury brands doing something similar. They have ""imported"" workers from China to work in the small factories in Italy at a very low hourly rate so they can label their product as made in Italy and charge 10 times the price.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
You‘re absolutely a journalist. This is journalism. Don‘t sell yourself short.,shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"Don't sell yourself short. This is excellent journalism YouTube or not. In fact, probably the best journalism can be found on this platform now. Great job and thank you.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village

"The willful ignorance of all these ""fashion influencers"" showing boxes of SheIn and Temu clothes is what is fuelling this incredibly abusive fast fashion industry.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"This is really good journalism. Shein is madness: labor costs are low, the product is low quality, people buy millions of clothes, then throw them in the trash after one use, causing an environmental disaster.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
Danke! We need people informing consumers like you do - in the interest of both workers and consumers. Plese keep up the good work!,shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"You may not think you're a journalist, but this video is better than a lot of videos I've seen so-called ""Journalists"" produce. Great work.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"For those saying they can't afford to purchase better quality clothing, that's the fast fashion concept. Slowing fashion down means planning what you're going to buy, saving up for it & investing in pieces that will last long, making sure you spend your hard earned money with companies that treat their workers fairly",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"One I noticed in this video that you are absolutely wrong about is that you are not a journalist. This is quality journalism, and you are most definitely a journalist.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"People in my city do in person clothing swap events and they've become my favorite way to ""shop""–you bypass the additional hassle/waste of thrift stores where they often have to throw away huge piles of clothes because there's just too much, and it's a really nice social event/way to connect with the community AND let go of clothes you don't wear anymore. We do it in parks and end up inviting anyone who walks by to look through the clothes too.",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"For ""just being a youtuber"" you really handled this investigation with care, respect, and a professional polish that reminds me of news segments. This is really well done and incredibly important work. Thank you!!!",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
“The ‘fast’ in fast fashion comes from human endurance.” What a line and reminder,shein,Inside Shein’s factory village
"Here’s the thing though, we all watch this from another country and feel bad about the working conditions but then we all still order products made from people in this condition. What needs to happen is consumerism needs to calm down. We don’t need to make a purchase every day. We don’t need to buy random products on SHEIN or Amazon simply because they are cheap are cute. This is the reality of those purchases. We line the pockets of people like Jeff bezos and we add to the demand for these people to work 18 hour shifts

*edit* I never said it was a United States issue, lol. Most modern world countries participate in senseless consumerism. Please read correctly before coming at me in the comments saying I said it was only Americans, I never said that",shein,Inside Shein’s factory village

People don't realize it. But this is one of the greatest albums of this generation. This is one of the greatest albums of the past 17 years. Frank is a true artist and he can speak to all levels of society. I hope frank gives us another album some day soon. Thank you Mr.Ocean.,nike,Frank Ocean - Nikes
"I feel like the album is titled blonde because blonde hair is often bright when one is young, but it begins to darken as they age. I feel like this is used to discuss how we lose our freedom with age. After the nights beat switch, the album takes a darker tone. In the first half of the album (before nights) frank uses high-pitched vocals to represent his younger self. he also mentions the word summer several times in this album which usually represent youth and freedom. In the second half of the album (after the nights beat switch) he only references summer once when Andre 3000 says he is “watching the summer come close to an end” which sounds like a representation of the end of his childhood.",nike,Frank Ocean - Nikes

Love how he uses the high pitched voice to start the album. Up until this point it had been 4 years since we had heard from Frank so that was a good tease to start things off. Once it leads into his real voice it’s almost like an explosion,nike,Frank Ocean - Nikes

"This song sounds like new to me - the start of summer, the start of a new love, the start of nothing, so to speak. It has a somber, nostalgic tone to it - you can tell this is a song about looking back, not about living. Through the album, the new feeling (especially in the context of 4 years waiting for an album) tells the beginning, middle, and end of a time in your life. That's what makes it so relatable - we all have our lived experience, which we link intrinsically with the first half of Blonde, and the second half grounds us to our lives now. It's one of the realest, most evocative albums ever",nike,Frank Ocean - Nikes
"I’m a big fan of what Asics, New Balance, and Adidas have been doing lately. Jordan and Nike tho, I’m just so burnt out. I got into sneakers around 2022 and I think I picked a good time back then. If I had hopped on now, it would’ve been the worst time with the tariffs, the price increases, and the overall fatigue of Nike and Jordan in sneaker culture. Everyone has nike and/or jordans. They aren’t special anymore, most of them are rereleases or just shoes without a story. Just more colorways of the same shoes everyone already has.

With New Balance, I love the collabs they do. Especially with stuff like amine or action bronson. They always have creative designs and backstories to accompany the shoe. Also the quality control with other companies is significantly better lately.",nike,TOP 10 BEST SNEAKERS OF 2025

"Have you heard of SHEIN, or have you shopped there yourself?",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"I'm guilty of being a SHEIN consumer. I started a few years back when they were not well known. I was shocked by the low prices and fast delivery. I loved it, absolutely loved the possibility to have a new outfit every week. In the last 1 month I stumbled upon a few youtube documentaries on fast fashion and SHEIN in particular. After the first documentary I withdraw all the money off my SHEIN wallet and deleted the app. Honestly... it's a bit addicting. I used to scroll the new clothes before going to bed. Kinda miss that but I'm okay with putting an end to it.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"I absolutely agree to the conclusions drawn here: With every purchase we make a decision that impacts on nature and society. I'd rather buy less clothes, but of good quality so that I can wear them for years.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"Zara, H&M and Uniqlo are considered fast fashion, yet here in my country it’s still considered to be quite expensive. Although definitely not a high-end product, it’s mid to upper level for sure.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"As a designer (of mostly crochet tops and sweaters) it pains me to see that SHEIN steals the designs of other small shops/creators like myself. So far I haven't been hit but many of my friends have. We work so hard on these designs, only to have them get stolen and sold for $7.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"For me, the question is: how can we help young people to accept themselves and be resistant to this toxic consumerist manipulation?",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"“We are students…low on funds” yet I can see a bag strap with the LV monogram all over it 

Let’s face it, majority of people who are buying insane amounts of clothing from any fast fashion brand is doing it to keep up with the trends 

When I stopped following trends and found my own personal style that suits me, I found it much much easier to resist buying new clothes every other week. Not only does this save my wallet and the planet, I found yourself much happier with the clothes I have and didn’t have the “I have nothing to wear” feeling anymore",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
The issue is honestly that we overconsume… i know damn well the girl that said „why would i pay more when i can have it for less“ buys clothes regularly every month which SHOULDNT be the norm. You dont need 10000pieces of clothing. We need to get back to the mindset where less is more.,shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"Also remember, clothes from well known fashion brands and that are more expensive not necessarily means good quality or ethically made too. Just stop over consuming clothes and be mindful with what we wear. Don’t follow fashion trends, they just want you to spend!",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
I completely agree. Btw Zara and other more expensive clothing stores are still fast fashion too! even though they’re more expensive. Mid/higher end prices doesn’t equal good quality in the U.S ):,shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"This makes me so angry because the ones who are usually used as scapegoats when it comes to condemning fast fashion are the people who really have no choice. Not everybody has the means and privilege to afford sustainable clothing. 
And then there's people doing massive Shein hauls for hundreds or even thousands of bucks, meaning they clearly have the funds to make better, more ethical and sustainable choices but they simply choose not to because doing a massive haul of the latest trends is good content.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
Not to mention how Shein routinely steals designs and intellectual property from small designers (particularly minority designers) and outsells them before the designers can even do anything about it,shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"As a girl in highschool (I live in the Netherlands) who thrifts all of her clothes (everything except for of course underwear and swimwear), I really hate shein. It is not only bad for the environment, but people also don’t KNOW that it is bad. I see more and more clothes from shein in thrift shops and people just aren’t aware enough of the downsides of fast fashion.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"I’m so glad fast fashion brands like shein were banned in India recently, it’s worth the sacrifice since it will hopefully allow local creators to blossom and lower the demand immensely on the unethical factories that make these clothes",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"To the kids saying they don't have money to buy anything more expensive: just don't. Don't buy it. You don't really need it and it's not worth it. If you want a cheap winter jacket etc, buy second hand, there are mountains of discarded clothes waiting to be recycled or burned",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"The problem wasn't your average person who buy clothes, it's the people who hauls because the price is so cheap and ended up no even wearing them",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"Everyone around me buys Shein. Now, I do understand the fact that why go spend more when you can spend less. And it is true that not everybody can afford better brands and that almost all brands work like this nowadays. Honestly the reason I never gave in to Shein or other stuff is because they also steal artists work. I mostly thrift my clothes, or don't buy at all. If I have to, I stay in between my budget by trying to polluting less. My advices especially to young people are:
- don't buy what you don't really need
- don't buy what you don't really like
- buy what lasts
- buy versatile, basic essentials clothing to mix and match
- only splurge once in a while and try to make it a good sustainable one
- swap clothes w friends, relatives etc or thrift them
- ignore the urge to mass buy you don't need that many clothes",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"As I have gotten older, I highly value the quality of a well made piece of clothing. I've been buying a LOT of made in the US clothing. I want the opposite of fast fashion. I want to buy clothes that maybe can last me the rest of my life.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"
"It was formerly named ""She Inside"", then changed into just ""She-in"", so that's how it's pronounced.

"We need to stop treating climate change like it's an individual problem. It's the corporations we need to be talking to, not trying to dish out responsibility to poor/broke people. Katy Perry and the like have no excuse, but MOST people cannot afford to spend $80 on one piece of sustainable clothing.

Edit: U can argue until u turn blue, but the fact is 100 energy companies are responsible for 71% of **ALL** emissions.",shein,"If you think fast fashion is bad, check out SHEIN"

That's not legal, it's a crime.
There's no customer support the company only respond automatically through a robot which makes the way they treat customers even more disgusting and despicable.
This was the LAST time any member of my family will make any purchases from Shein and I will disclose as much as possible about this execrable system of usurping other people's money.

"I ordered four blouses from Shein that were advertised as 100% cotton. They were not, they were the cheapest possible synthetic, and I tried to go through the return process. It is horribly designed on the site (each item purchased seems to be its own ""order"" and each must be photographed, with apparently a separate mailing label for each, it's a real mess of dead ends and loops), and I was not able to complete it on the site, but did get in touch with customer service. They sent me a return label and I sent the blouses back through UPS. Shein never acknowledged receipt and did not refund the blouses. At my complaint, they sent me one of the blouses back! The representative refused to put me in touch with a senior staff member and refused all my attempts to get a refund. Horrible, horrible service.",shein,Buyers Beware!

Great idea, and here I thought they were focusing on spaghetti",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
Its simple. People dont want to buy ugly overpriced items. Its time to learn it!,nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"Two things Nike can do to make a comeback: 

1. Make them affordable for god’s sake. 
2. Make them more comfortable.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"I walked into a store where they sell athlethic gear, saw a normal Nike sweater for 89.99. Keep in mind, it is just a normal sweater with the nike logo. At the same time, in the store next by, they sell other brands for 19.99. I have never bought a Nike item in my adult life except for shoes that were on sale once. Nothing else.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
The problem is that Nike isn't cool anymore,nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"Make Retro 1-14 Jordans COMFORTABLE for Lifestyle wear.

Don't mess with how it looks from the outside, that's what we like. Just make it comfortable, it's not for playing basketball anymore.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"So there’s no new plan? “Focus on Sports” how? No details, no goals, no information?",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"When I was a teenager I was into Nikes, now getting older, I bought my first pair of New Balances (530), wow! The wide toe box, the comfortability, the style.. I’ll be sticking with NB for a while lol, may even try Asics too",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"Nike, listen up! Here is what you need to focus on: The customer! 
I buy several pairs of running shoes every year. I will only buy in a brick-and-mortar store after trying them on because I am slightly older and only shoes with a great fit and the right amount of cushioning and stability will enable me to run and walk safely and pain free. Despite living in a reasonably large city (300K residents) I have in recent years not been able to lay my hands on any of your more premium offerings. I am not talking about the lifestyle/fashion stuff here. I have several sports retailers available, but they only carry very limited supplies of Nike, at best one or two of the models that would be of interest to me, and my size, which is very common, is almost always out of stock. I know that Nike makes some great shoes, but I would have to travel hundreds of miles to find a store with a full selection. So my money has gone to Brooks, Asics and Hoka, despite having a lot of respect for Nike.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"Nike’s been talking about a “turn around” for years now, yet nothing has changed. They’re still overpriced for the quality you get and still not comfortable.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"This CEO doesn't understand two things. One, Nike is not athletic gear anymore, it's athleisure wear. Two, it's too expensive nowadays.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"I saw a Nike t shirt for $50 dollars, A T SHIRT! How can anyone justify a 50 dollar expense for a garment worth $3 dollars?",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
No new idea needed. Just improve your quality guys and make your products worth those inflated prices thanks😊,nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"In my opinion, Nike should make wider shoes. It's really uncomfortable to wear. I went with Adidas Cloud foam",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"The prices of Nike items need to be cheaper, especially the clothes! That would help them a lot!",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"How about, stop upping your prices ? 
$200-300 per shoe is ridiculous",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"He didn’t bite on your tariff talk or passing cost to consumers. 😂. 
We all know they pass the cost down to consumers.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
"Part of the problem is that the hype surrounding Nike and Jordan products has fizzled out. The company raised prices, flooded the market with too many releases, oversaturated retro models, and failed to deliver major new innovations. This combination killed much of the resale market by overproducing product and eliminating scarcity. At the same time, the cost of living has skyrocketed, and the core consumer base between the ages of 15 and 40 has been hit hardest by these changes. A significant portion of that group is also aging out of the brand, which makes Nike’s drop in popularity easier to understand.",nike,How Nike’s New CEO Plans To Turn Things Around
